Linear transport theory deals with the study of equations describing the migration of particles or energy within a host medium.

This project deals with the 1-dimensional linear transport equation. Numerical solutions are calculated for the partial differential equation.
For this purpose, three explicit finite-difference methods are used:
1. 1st-order Upwind Method
2. Lax-Wendroff Method
3. 4th order Runge-Kutta 

The numerical solutions are calculated for two different Courant numbers:
i) 0.999 (close to the stability limit)
ii) 0.5  (below the stability limit)

The numerical solutions are then compared to the analytical solution.

To understand the derivation of the numerical methods and to read the conclusion, please view the "Final_report.pdf" file.
